# Project roles

## Contributor

The contributor role is the starting role for anyone participating in the project and wishing to contribute code.

### Process for becoming a contributor

* Review the [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to ensure your contribution is inline with the project's coding and styling guidelines.
* Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO signoff
* Have your submission approved by the committer(s) and merged into the codebase.

## Committers

The Committers role enables the contributor to commit code directly to the repository, but also comes with the responsibility of being a responsible leader in the community.

Currently Committers of Docling are (in alphabetic order): [Cesar Berrospi Ramis](https://github.com/ceberam), [Kasper Dinkla](https://github.com/kdinkla), [Yusik Kim](https://github.com/kmyusk), [Nikos Livathinos](https://github.com/nikos-livathinos), [Maxim Lysak](https://github.com/maxmnemonic), [Ahmed Nassar](https://github.com/nassarofficial), [Matteo Omenetti](https://github.com/Matteo-Omenetti), [Rafael Teixeira de Lima](https://github.com/rateixei), [Viktor Kuropiatnyk](https://github.com/vku-ibm), [Anil Vishnoi](https://github.com/vishnoianil).


### Process for becoming a committers

Contributors can become committers by beeing nominated by at least one other committers of Docling. There will be a vote by the TSC members. While it is expected that most votes will be unanimous, a two-thirds majority of the cast votes is enough.


## TSC members

The Techincal Steering Commite (TSC) members are committers who have additional responsibilities to ensure the smooth running of the project. TSC members are expected to participate in strategic planning, and approve changes to the governance model. The purpose of the TSC is to ensure a smooth progress from the big-picture perspective.

Currently TSC menbers of Docling are (in alphabetic order): [Christoph Auer](https://github.com/cau-git), [Michele Dolfi](https://github.com/dolfim-ibm), [Peter Staar](https://github.com/PeterStaar-IBM), [Panos Vagenas](https://github.com/vagenas).

One of the TSC members is the chairperson of the TSC and should ensure the smooth running of the TSC. They do not have more voting power that other TSC menber.

Currently [Peter Staar](https://github.com/PeterStaar-IBM) is the chairperson of the TSC

### Process for becoming a TSC member

At the moment, the TSC is not open for new members. This is expected to change after the first 24 months.
